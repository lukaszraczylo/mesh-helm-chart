# Traefik Mesh

Traefik Mesh is a simple, yet full-featured service mesh. It is container-native and fits as your de-facto service mesh in your Kubernetes cluster.
It supports the latest Service Mesh Interface specification [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) that facilitates integration with pre-existing solution.

Moreover, Traefik Mesh is opt-in by default, which means that your existing services are unaffected until you decide to add them to the mesh.

## Prerequisites
